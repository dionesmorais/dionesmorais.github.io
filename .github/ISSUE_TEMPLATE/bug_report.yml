        Before opening a new issue please:

        - Verify you have the latest versions of Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes
          installed by running `bundle update`.
        - Thoroughly read the theme's documentation at
          https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/
        - Search all issues at https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues
          for solutions and to avoid duplication.
        - Ask for help at https://talk.jekyllrb.com/

        If none of the above solved your problem, you can continue below.

        Please include theme version, Jekyll version, public git repository, whether
        you are hosting with GitHub Pages, and the operating system you tested with.

        Issues without a link to a public repository or ZIP file will likely go ignored.
        Being able to see your actual files is necessary to troubleshoot, as most
        issues stem from invalid/missing YAML Front Matter, a mis-configured _config.yml
        file, or problematic site content.

        the theme, customized _config.yml, added your own posts, and started up a
        Jekyll server locally.

        If an error occurred on GitHub Pages when pushing, please test a local version
        following these setup instructions:
        https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/

        Then provide a complete log by running `bundle exec jekyll build --trace --verbose`
        and include this output in the filed issue.

        Screenshots can also be included if they help illustrate a behavior.
